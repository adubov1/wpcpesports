To put it simply, an Esport is a multiplayer video game played competitively for spectators. Some titles you may have heard of may include Fortnite, League of Legends, Rocket League and Super Smash Bros Ultimate among others. Players participate on teams against other teams in tournaments for prize pools that reached a total amount of $149 million in 2018 and continues to grow today. Esports was recently in the news due to the Fortnite World Cup which boasted a prize pool of $30 million and the company behind Fortnite stating they would be giving out $100 million in prizes over the course of 2019.  As the e-Sports industry continues to grow, it will eventually bring in $1 billion in revenue during 2019.

## Why are esports growing so much lately?
<br>
Developers realized the potential of esports and started getting more involved, which has led to more money, better broadcasts, and higher production values. In turn, live streaming started to become increasingly more popular through platforms like Twitch, allowing esports players across the world to bring in steady incomes. Ninja, a Fortnite streamer with the largest following on any streaming site, currently has over 14.5 million followers and gets over 30 million views on his streams. Streamers with such a large viewer base are able to get deals with advertisers that see the value in having millions of people see their products.

## Why are esports important at the high school level?

Esports encourages communication and coordination amongst student athletes. By playing games, students are able to deepen their levels of interaction and communicate more effectively, readying them for later life.  Esports is a booming industry as is shown by the constant growth. Many job opportunities besides being a pro player are being created. Esports teaches participants many relevant skills, such as streaming, production, programming, and management. Members of the WPCP esports program have also stated that being on an esports team was important to them as they otherwise would not have gotten the experience of being on a team.

<br>
Nearly 200 US colleges are offering around $15 million per year in scholarships for the esports elite with the average esports scholarship student receiving $4,800 in tuition awards a year, according to the National Association of Collegiate Esportsâ€”but some can receive up to half off tuition. College students seem to be pursuing esports as a legitimate career and they may be on to something -  The 2018 League of Legends World Championship attracted more viewers than the Super Bowl and the NCAA Final Four combined.
